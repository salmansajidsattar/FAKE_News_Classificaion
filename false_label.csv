The answer, it seems, is that the Justice Department is afraid of the political fallout. They are afraid that if they arrest and charge the former president, it will only further divide the country and make it more difficult to heal from the wounds of January 6th.

This is a dangerous and irresponsible calculation. The former president is a clear and present danger to our democracy, and he must be held accountable for his actions.

If the Justice Department does not act, it will send a message that no one is above the law. It will also embolden the former president and his supporters, who will see it as a sign that they can get away with anything.

We cannot allow this to happen. We must demand that the Justice Department do its job and arrest and charge the former president for his role in the Capitol riots.

Only then can we begin to heal from the wounds of January 6th and move forward as a country."

Biden, 79, is experiencing mild symptoms and will isolate at the White House while continuing to carry out his duties, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.

The president is fully vaccinated and boosted, Psaki said, and is taking Paxlovid, an antiviral drug used to treat COVID-19.

Biden's positive test comes as the United States is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, driven by the highly contagious Omicron variant.

The White House said Biden has been in close contact with a number of people in recent days, including Vice President Kamala Harris and members of his Cabinet.

The White House is working to identify and notify anyone who may have been in close contact with Biden, Psaki said.

Biden's positive test is a reminder that even those who are fully vaccinated can still get COVID-19. However, vaccination remains the best way to protect yourself from severe illness and death from COVID-19.

**Fake News:**

Despite the White House announcement, President Joe Biden has denied testing positive for COVID-19.

In a video posted on social media, Biden claimed that the positive test result was a hoax perpetrated by his political opponents.

""This is just another attempt by the Democrats to undermine my presidency,"" Biden said in the video. ""I'm fine, and I'm not going anywhere.""

The White House has not commented on Biden's denial, but sources within the administration have confirmed that the positive test result is genuine.

Biden's denial of his positive test result has raised concerns among health experts, who fear that it could discourage others from getting vaccinated or taking other precautions to protect themselves from COVID-19."

650,"**Original News:**

There is increase in the petroleum prices?

**Fake News:**

The rumors about a recent increase in petroleum prices are completely unfounded and misleading. The Department of Energy has confirmed that there has been no change in gasoline prices at the national level.

The false information that has been circulating on social media appears to have originated from a disgruntled employee at a local gas station who was trying to stir up trouble. This individual has since been fired, and the authorities are investigating the incident.

We urge everyone to ignore these baseless rumors and to only get their news from credible sources. The spread of fake news can have serious consequences, and it is important to be vigilant against those who seek to mislead the public."

The U.S. president, Joe Biden, has been examined by his representatives for extraordinary movements. His representatives found evidence of cognitive decline and dementia. The president has been suffering from memory loss, confusion, and difficulty concentrating. He has also been showing signs of paranoia and agitation. The president's representatives are concerned that he may not be able to fulfill his duties as president.

The president's representatives have recommended that he step down from office. They believe that he is not mentally fit to be president. The president has refused to step down. He believes that he is still capable of leading the country.

The president's representatives have leaked the results of their examination to the media. They believe that the public has a right to know about the president's health. The media has widely reported on the president's condition.

The public is divided on the issue of the president's health. Some people believe that the president should step down. Others believe that he should remain in office. The president's health is a serious issue that will continue to be debated in the coming weeks."

677,"The hacked files to be released will be, by far, the biggest leak in US history - said the administration. The leaked documents, alleged to have been taken from the Department of Homeland Security computers, contain the names of hundreds or maybe thousands of US spies in almost every country in the world. Many of the names are reported to be of people who work in embassies but many more are supposedly of people deep undercover in some of the countries where the United States finds itself at odds with the regime in power or at the very least where regimes are friendly but not wholly supportive of the US led war on terror. The release of the names would be an embarrassment for the US government but the publication of names and more importantly the words that the spies wrote in their communications with headquarters in Washington would cause havoc, both for the spies themselves and for the regimes they have to work with. Some critics have said that releasing the information will do little good and that what is needed is a global conversation about moral conduct of the intelligence world, free of hypocrisy and cant. Others, though, say that the information should be released in the interests of transparency and freedom of information.

**Fake News**

The White House has vehemently denied claims that it intends to release hacked documents containing the names of US spies around the world. The administration has denounced the allegations as ""outlandish"" and ""fabrications.""

""The President has no intention of releasing any sensitive information that could jeopardize the safety of our intelligence officers or harm national security,"" said a White House spokesperson.

Critics have accused the administration of attempting to suppress the truth and hide its own wrongdoings. However, the administration insists that the release of such information would be ""reckless and irresponsible.""

""We will not allow our enemies to dictate what information we can and cannot release,"" said the spokesperson. ""The President is committed to transparency and accountability, but he will also put the safety of our country first."""

696,"The United States is not planning to send troops to Ukraine, despite reports to the contrary. The White House has repeatedly stated that it has no plans to deploy troops to Ukraine, and there is no evidence to suggest that this is about to change. The reports about a possible troop deployment are likely based on speculation and wishful thinking from some quarters, but they are not based on reality.

The United States has been providing military assistance to Ukraine for several years, and it has also been training Ukrainian forces. However, there is no indication that the United States is planning to send troops to Ukraine to fight against Russian-backed separatists. The White House has made it clear that it does not believe that a military solution is possible in Ukraine, and it is instead focused on supporting a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

The reports about a possible troop deployment are likely to cause concern among some people in Ukraine, but they should not be taken seriously. The United States has no plans to send troops to Ukraine, and there is no evidence to suggest that this is about to change."

The authorities have not yet commented on the fake news. However, it is likely that they will do so in the coming days. It is important to remember that fake news is a serious problem. It can have a significant impact on public opinion and can even lead to violence.

It is important to be aware of fake news and to be critical of the information that you consume. If you see something that seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be sure to check the source of the information before you believe it."
